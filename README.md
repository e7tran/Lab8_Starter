# Lab 8 - Starter
1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.  
Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed, because we want to test the code for every push so that testing is incremental and not just at the end.
2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)  
No, if we are just checking for the correct output that is only one end so there is no need for end to end test.
